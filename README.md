# Overwatch_League_Scraper

This is my web scraper created with python. 

I originally started this project because I play Overwatch competitively, and love watching the Overwatch League, which has teams
of professional gamers play against one another. I wanted to learn from those games to improve my own skills, and I thought 
seeing how my statistics stack up against those of pros in the role I play would be a great start!

While I am happy with how much I've learned just from building a web scraper and spending more time working with python, I do 
want to take this project further. 

My next steps are to take user input to compare to the professionals' statistics, and display this information on a website.

Thank you for checking out my code! :)
